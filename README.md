# PHP Number Combination Application Deployment on AWS EC2

This project involves the deployment of a simple PHP Number Combination application on an Amazon EC2 instance. The setup follows cloud best practices by leveraging a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a secure, scalable architecture.

## Resources Utilized

- **Amazon VPC**  
  - Configured with **public and private subnets** across **2 Availability Zones** for high availability and separation of concerns.

- **Internet Gateway**  
  - Attached to the VPC to allow **public internet access** for instances in the public subnet.

- **Security Groups**  
  - Custom security group created to allow:
    - **SSH (port 22)** for secure terminal access
    - **HTTP (port 80)** to serve the PHP web application

- **Amazon EC2 Instance**  
  - Launched in the **public subnet** to host the PHP application and make it accessible over the internet.
